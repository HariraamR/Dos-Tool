## Description
The DoS Tool is a Python script designed to perform Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. It sends a high volume of requests to a specified target website, potentially causing it to become unresponsive or unavailable.
## Usage
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
```
pip install requests
```
3. Run the script using the following command:
```
python dos_tool.py
```

## Configuration

You can modify the following variables within the script to customize the behavior:

- `threads`: The number of threads to be used for making concurrent requests. Adjust this based on your system capabilities.
- `message`: The message to be displayed while performing the attack. You can modify this to suit your needs.

## Disclaimer

Please note that using this tool to perform DoS attacks without proper authorization is illegal and unethical. The purpose of this tool is for educational and testing purposes only. Use it responsibly and with the appropriate permissions.
